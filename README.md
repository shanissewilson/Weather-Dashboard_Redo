# Description
This is a 5-day weather forecast dashboard using Open Weather Api.

# Usage
Users can type in a city in the search bar on the left hand corner. They will then be presented with the temperature as well as the wind speed, humidity, uv index. After a city has been searched, it will then be moved to the "history" section. Lastly users can decide if they want to clear the search history, or search up a different city.
